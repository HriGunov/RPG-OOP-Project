# RPG Project
### Our project is an attempt to create an engine that can run a basic console Rougelike game.

### What is a Rougelike ?


> A Roguelike is usually described as a free turn-based computer game with a strong focus on intricate gameplay and replayability, and an abstract world representation using ASCII-based display, as opposed to 3D graphics. Of course, as with any genre, there are deviations from the norm.
